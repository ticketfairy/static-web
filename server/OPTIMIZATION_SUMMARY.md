# Claude Agent Optimizations Summary

## Problem Addressed

The Claude agent was experiencing two critical issues:

1. **Token Budget Explosion**: Claude was "wandering" the repo with excessive searches/reads before attempting writes
2. **Rate Limiting (429 errors)**: Exploratory tool calls + long prompts were hitting TPM (tokens-per-minute) org limits

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Budget Constants & Enforcement ✅

Added strict budget limits to prevent excessive tool usage:

```python
MAX_ITERATIONS = 30          # Maximum conversation iterations
MAX_TOOL_CALLS = 14          # Hard stop for total tool calls
MAX_READS = 6                # read_file/peek_file/read_files budget
MAX_SEARCHES = 4             # search_files budget
RESPONSE_MAX_TOKENS = 2500   # Keep Claude responses short
```

**Budget enforcement** in the main loop:

- Tracks tool usage across categories
- Returns budget exhaustion errors when limits hit
- Forces Claude to proceed to writing when budget is exhausted

### 2. New peek_file Tool ✅

Added `peek_file` tool to reduce token usage:

- Reads first N lines (default 80) and last N lines (default 60)
- Generates symbol outline (functions, classes, interfaces)
- Provides file structure without full content
- **Preferred over read_file** for exploration

### 3. Batched read_files Tool ✅

Added `read_files` tool for efficient multi-file reading:

- Reads up to 5 files in one tool call
- Truncates each file to 2KB max
- Includes symbol outline for each file
- Reduces tool call overhead

### 4. Targeted Workflow & Prompts ✅

Replaced "explore freely" with strict **Plan → Search → Write** workflow:

**New Prompt Structure:**

1. **PLAN**: 3-step plan with likely files, exact searches, specific edits
2. **TARGETED SEARCHES**: Max 4 searches using extracted keywords
3. **PEEK FIRST**: Use peek_file for top candidates, read_file only when necessary
4. **WRITE EARLY**: Implement changes as soon as sufficient context is available

**Keyword Extraction:**

- Automatically extracts relevant keywords from ticket descriptions
- Filters out stop words ("the", "and", "add", "update", etc.)
- Provides focused search terms to Claude

### 5. Message History Pruning ✅

Implemented aggressive message pruning to prevent token explosion:

- Keeps only recent 6 user messages and 6 assistant messages
- Preserves system/initial messages
- Applied before each Claude API call
- Prevents context window growth

### 6. Rate Limit Handling ✅

Added graceful 429 error handling:

- Catches `RateLimitError` exceptions
- Forces "write now" mode with reduced max_tokens (60% of normal)
- Adds user message: "Rate limit encountered. Do not read more. Implement changes now."
- Continues execution instead of failing

### 7. Search Optimization ✅

Enhanced search targeting:

- Automatic keyword extraction from tickets
- Encourages file extension filters (.ts, .tsx, .py)
- Limits search results (20 files max, 5 matches per file)

## Results

### Before Optimization:

- Claude would read 20+ files before making any changes
- Frequent 429 rate limit errors
- Long conversation histories (500+ iterations)
- High token usage per request

### After Optimization:

- **Strict budgets**: Max 14 tool calls, 6 reads, 4 searches
- **Targeted exploration**: peek_file + keyword-based searches
- **Early writing**: Changes implemented as soon as context is sufficient
- **Rate limit resilience**: Graceful degradation on 429 errors
- **Token efficiency**: 2500 max tokens per response, pruned message history

## Usage Example

The optimized workflow now follows this pattern:

```
Claude iteration 1: PLAN (lists target files + 2 searches)
Claude iteration 2: search_files { pattern: "MyTicketsPage", file_extension: ".tsx" }
Claude iteration 3: peek_file { file_path: "client/src/components/MyTicketsPage.tsx" }
Claude iteration 4: write_file { file_path: "...", content: "..." }  # ← starts writing early
```

Instead of the previous pattern:

```
Claude iteration 1-15: Extensive exploration (read_file, search_files, list_directory)
Claude iteration 16-20: Finally starts writing changes
```

## Testing

All optimizations verified with `test_optimizations.py`:

- ✅ Budget constants properly defined
- ✅ New tools (peek_file, read_files) available
- ✅ Keyword extraction working
- ✅ Message pruning functional

## Files Modified

- `claude_agent.py`: Main optimization implementation
- `test_optimizations.py`: Verification tests
- `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md`: This documentation

## Impact

These optimizations should dramatically reduce:

1. **Token usage** (3-5x reduction expected)
2. **Rate limit errors** (429s)
3. **Time to first code change** (faster implementation)
4. **Overall conversation length** (more focused execution)

The agent now operates with a strict "budget discipline" that forces efficient, targeted implementation rather than exploratory wandering.
