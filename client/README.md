# Ticket Fairy

Ticket Fairy makes creating tickets as easy as explaining them out loud. Team leaders record a short video of themselves talking and their screen, pointing and showing context with their mouse. The tool captures both the screen recording and the speaker's video, then uses AI to transform this into a structured, ready-to-use ticket with text fields while preserving the video for richer context. The UI and experience of creating and reading these tickets is designed to feel delightful, human, and frictionlessâ€”making working with your team easy and exciting by abstracting annoying tasks and allowing leaders to become more effective communicators.
